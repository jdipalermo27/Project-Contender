The .gct file contains codes that modify the game. 
The codes in the supplied .gct are File Patch Code 3.5.1 and Disable Custom Stages.
File Patch Code 3.5.1 allows you to use the mods on your sd card in the game.
Disable Custom Stages makes you unable to use stages that you made in the game.

In order to use a sd card larger than two gigabytes, use the SDHC Extension and Project M Launcher.
Here is the SDHC Extension: http://forums.kc-mm.com/index.php?topic=65342.0 and Project M Launcher: https://www.mediafire.com/?v81jj912gb5jbv2

Put the Project M Launcher in your apps folder. Open you .gct in an editor and add the SDHC Extension.
